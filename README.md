## Overview

Case Cats and Dogs is a deep learning project built to classify images of pets as either 'cat' or 'dog'. Leveraging the power of neural networks, this project provides an efficient and accurate solution for pet image classification.

The model is trained on a diverse dataset consisting of thousands of labeled cat and dog images. By analyzing the unique features and patterns in each image, the neural network can make accurate predictions, allowing you to determine whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Features

- Deep learning model for cat and dog image classification
- Pre-trained on a large dataset of labeled cat and dog images
- Utilizes advanced neural network architecture for accurate predictions
- Furthermore, the project is still in progress and new commits will happen soon.
